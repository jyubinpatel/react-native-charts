# react-native-charts
Develop this sample example inspired from  MPAndroidChart for Android and Charts for iOS.
I have used react-native-mp-android-chart and react-native-ios-charts.
Follow below commands to use this library:

1. yarn add react-native-charts
2. yarn add @babel/runtime
3. react-native link
4. cd ios && pod install
5. react-native run-android / react-native run-ios.

Please let me know if you found any difficulties to run.
